Hi All,

RPG 3D Gamemaker is a 3D Gameengine that I have made to be able to generate
RPG 3D Games like Eye of the Beholder and Lands of Lore.

In this Game-engine you define the maps, the backdrops (ceiling+floor), the
walls, the doors, the stairs, the items, the weapons, the characters and the
monsters from your RPG 3D Game.

At the end you Generate the RPG 3D Game and then a separate RPG Database
will be created which can be used in a RPG 3D Game like f.i. Dark Moon RPG.

When you open the solution in Visual Studio 2008 then don't forget to move all the maps 
(except My Project) to the bin/debug directory when you want to run the code.

Good luck,
Reiniere.
